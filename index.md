## Who we are

We are a bunch of physical modellers at the Sonic Arts Research Centre (SARC) at Queen's University Belfast (QUB).

## What we enjoy doing

Modelling the physics of musical instruments and simulating them digitally using numerical methods are some of the things we are most passionate about. Apart from these, we enjoy making sensor interfaces and create virtual-acoustic instruments as well.

## Why a reading club?

_"Books serve to show a man that those original thoughts of his are not very new after all - Abraham Lincoln"_

Well, this may not always be true. However, taking inspiration from Lincoln, we want to read,  understand and learn from the _original thoughts_ of others, so that there is a chance - even if it is ever so slim - of us getting a few _original thoughts_ ourselves. Further, we all know that knowledge multiplies when shared. Hence we aim to meet at SARC once every two weeks to discuss what we have read and learn from each other in the process.

## What we read about

The topics we read and discuss about include but are not limited to the following:

*   Musical acoustics
*   Digital signal processing
*   Numerical methods
*   Partial differential equations
*   Electronics and sensor technologies

## Why a website?

_"If it is not documented, it did not happen"_, goes a popular saying. The purpose of this website is to document the discussions in the club, for future reference.

## Website organisation

This website has a simple organisation: the proceedings of the club are organised by year on the left hand side.

## Example equations

$$
\begin{align}
e^{j \theta} &= \cos{\theta} + j\ \sin{\theta},\quad \theta \in \mathbb{R}, \\
\mathbf{A} \mathbf{x} &= \mathbf{b}'
\end{align}
$$
